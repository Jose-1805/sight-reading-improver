README for MusiQwik and MusiQwikB, version 4.00:

***** Revision History:

This is version 4.00, released April 2003. Changes: slight internal coding change. Most users will not notice the difference from version 3.41, but the version 4.00 font may work in some applications that did not properly process all of the earlier versions.

There are two fonts in the MusiQwik family: MusiQwik, and MusiQwikB. The difference is that MusiQwikB has 1/16 notes in places where MusiQwik has 1/8 notes. Version prior to 3.41 referred to MusiQwikB and "MusiQwik Bold" but this confused some applications, as is it not a bold font.

Prior version 3.41 was released in November, 2002. There were some small dimensional changes to characters from earlier versions. Version 3.41 fixed an obscure code that might, under some circumstances, lead a program to classify it as an Asian-language font.

If you have a version prior to 3.41, remove it and install the more recent version.

***** Application:

MusiQwik is a special-purpose music notation font that may be used in various applications that accept True Type fonts. Be sure that you embed the font in your documents or re-distribute the font to those who wish to see your music, or reduce the notation to a bitmap image. Also be sure to inspect your music carefully, especially if you make use of ties or fermatas, since some applications will insert undesired white space.

MusicQwik is best used with a 16-column character map that places the space character in the leftmost column. There are free utilities for this purpose, such as "Typecase" for Windows, by Anthony Appleyard, available from sources such as www.simtel.net. I am told that similar utilities are available for Macintosh.

The font includes clefs, time signatures, key signatures, and a number of other staff symbols. It also includes elements for constructing notes from 1/1 to 1/8 duration, with or without accidental or dot, from pitch two ledger lines below the staff to one ledger line above it. This is sufficient for depicting the melodies of most popular songs and church hymns. The companion font, MusiQwikB, contains 1/16 notes instead of 1/8 notes.

Notes are organized by column, according to pitch. If your note is modified by an accidental or dot, select the modifier from the same column.

Fermatas and ties are designed to overhang the following symbol or symbols. In versions of this font prior to 3.41, these were "zero cursor width" symbols that confused some applications. This version assigns a nonzero cursor width. You may use the hyphen (-) key to insert a tiny segment of staff, if alignment of the notes is important. Regular sections of staff are inserted using the equal (=) key.

Be sure that word wrapping is turned off, or your staffs will break in unexpected locations.

This font looks best at 24 point size.

MusiQwik has been tested in MS Word 97 on Windows 98 and XP, MS Works 6, Notepad (98 and XP), Adobe Photoshop 5LE (98 and XP), Irfan View (98 and XP), and Open Office for Windows XP. Other applications and operating systems may accept Windows True Type fonts; I am told that Mac OS-X will. The only way to find out is to try it. Recipients of your files will not be able to see music unless the font is installed in their system. Some applications allow font embedding.

In many applications, the font name will appear as musical notation rather than "MusiQwik" in the list of available fonts. But it will still be located alphabetically under M (that is, after Lucida but before Palatino).

To use the font, it is best not to memorize keystrokes. Instead, use a suitable character map utility, and select character by clicking them. That will transfer characters to the clipboard (or, to a program buffer and then to the clipboard), from which they can be pasted into the target application.

If you are using Windows, there are at least two ways to create a bitmap image of your music, which can then be saved in a web-compatible file type such as GIF or JPG. You may be able to use a simple program such as Notepad to write the music and save the file. Using "print screen," the image is transfered to the clipboard. From there, it can be pasted into a suitable imaging application, and cropped. Even the simple Windows Paint utility will work for that purpose. I prefer the free "Irfan View."

Some older text editors will not show MusiQwik as notation. That's not the fault of the font: Try another application.

***** Use on the Internet

Alas, in early 2003 it is still not the case that web page font embedding is generally used. If you wish to use MusiQwik to place notation on a web page, you have three choices: (1) Re-distribute the font, and instruct users to install the font before viewing your web page. The disadvantages are that it takes time to download and install the font, and the font cannot be used on every operating system. (2) Create a PDF file of your music, viewable by Adobe Acrobat Reader. The disadvantages are that you need the technology to create PDF, and there is a delay while the Reader loads; the Reader may display the music larger or smaller than you intended; and the music cannot be placed in-line with something else. (3) Create a bitmap image of your notation, and place the image in your web page as GIF, JPG, or PNG. This is the best solution.

***** Special tips:

You will need to make liberal use of the blank staff segment (=) to space the notation. The ties and fermatas are designed to overhang one or more of the following characters.
